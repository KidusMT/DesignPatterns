# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns and Design Principles with their best practices and description

## Definitions
### Strategy 
> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
### Observer
> Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
### Factory
> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
