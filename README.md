# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns and Design Principles with their best practices and description

## Keywords for Memorization
### [Strategy](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/strategy):
> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
- family
- interchangable
- vary independenty

### [Factory](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/factory_method):
> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- family
- interchangable
- vary independenty

### [Visitor](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/visitor): O-P-E-S
> Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- represent an `Operation`
- `Performed` on an 
- `Elements` of object 
- in a `Structure`

### [Composite](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/composite): C-T-P-T
> Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- `Compose` 
- `Tree` structure
- represent `Part-whole` hierarchies
- `Treat` individual objects and compositions

### [Iterator](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/iterator): E-A-S-E
> Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- access `Element`
- `Aggregate` object
- `Squencially`
- wihtout `Exposing`

### [Proxy](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/proxy): S-P-A
> Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- `Surrogate`
- `Placeholder`
- control `Access`

## Difference between
- [Strategy vs State](https://www.javabrahman.com/design-patterns/strategy-design-pattern-versus-state-design-pattern-analysis/)

- [Proxy vs Decorator vs Adapter vs Facade](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/350404/how-do-the-proxy-decorator-adapter-and-bridge-patterns-differ)

- Decorator vs Adapter

|Decorator DP|Composite DP|
|----|----|
|add new behaviour|part-whole hierarchy|
|linear structure|tree structure|
|one dimensional|two dimensional|
|only one node|one or more nodes|
